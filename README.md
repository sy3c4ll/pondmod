# PondMod

A slightly modified version of Blockly Games: Pond, so that your ducks can compete with your friends'!

## Running

Simply double-click index.html! You will be automatically redirected to Pond.

Upon running, you'll be met with six prompts, each asking you for the name and code for three AIs. Have them prepared! If you don't have any code yourself, I've put the code for Counter, Rook and Sniper from the original game in `en/ai/` so that you can copy and paste.

This project is also being hosted on https://sy3c4ll.github.io/pondmod, courtesy of Github Pages!

## Tutorial

Just walk through the [Pond Tutor course](https://blockly.games/pond-tutor) of the original Blockly games, they'll explain it better than I ever can.

If you _have_ done that, but you still want a bit of tuning on all of the functions available, click on the `Documentation` button in-game.

## Credits

Credits to where credits are due! A massive thanks to Google for providing a wonderful [block-coding library](https://developers.google.com/blockly), and making a brilliant [coding game](https://blockly.games) out of it, _and_ licensing it under the Apache License so that anyone can view or modify the source code! Also, a shoutout to Tom Poindexter, creator of [Crobots](https://crobots.deepthought.it/), for inspiring Google to make the Pond edition of the game. This project could never have existed without their works.
